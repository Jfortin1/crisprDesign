Description: 
    Provides a comprehensive suite of functions to design and annotate CRISPR guide RNA (gRNAs) sequences. This 
    includes on- and off-target search, on-target efficiency scoring, off-target scoring, full gene and TSS
    contextual annotations, and SNP annotation (human only). It currently support four types of CRISPR 
    modalities (modes of perturbations): CRISPR knockout, CRISPR activation, CRISPR inhibition, and 
    CRISPR base editing (CRISPRbe). All types of CRISPR nucleases are supported. gRNA design can be performed
    on both reference genomes and custom DNA sequences.
